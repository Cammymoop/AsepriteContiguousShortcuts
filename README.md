###
Contiguous Paint Bucket Shortcuts Extension for Aseprite

Ever forget that you had the paint bucket in aseprite in non-contiguous mode and made everything red???
I have, so I made this

Adds 2 menu items that can be assigned keyboard shortcuts
Paint Bucket (Contiguous)
Paint Bucket (Non-Contiguous)

They each just select the paint bucket as the current tool and set the contiguous option
Set a keyboard shortcut to use them for best results (I suggest g and shift-g (unless you really want a shortcut for gradient))
Edit -> Keyboard Shortcuts

###Install
Just double click the .aseprite-extension file to install
